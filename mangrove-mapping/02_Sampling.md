# Collecting Ground-Truth Data

Ground-truth data is all the data we can collect from the field, visual observations, or existing datasets that will be used for training and validating classification models. In this case, we will focus on mangrove presence and absence data, using the previous datasets we prepared in the previous section. We have a previous mangrove distribution map, elevation data, NDVI data to distinguish vegetation, NDWI data to distinguish water, and the multispectral data. These datasets will help us to define sampling areas for mangrove presence and absence, and are expected to improve the classification output.
