# Introduction to Flood Mapping

Flood mapping is the detection of water above its usual level. Normally, the areas in risk of flooding are close to the coast, water bodies such as rivers or lakes, or areas with geomorphological characteristics that allows accumulation of water. Flooding may be caused by natural events such as high precipitations or sea-level rise, but some anthropogenic events can caused flooding by deforestion or lanscape changes.
