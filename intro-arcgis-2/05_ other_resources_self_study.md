A changing climate creates complex, interrelated, and inherently geographic challenges. Because it uses location as a common thread, GIS technology is uniquely suited to create clarity from myriad data sources and illuminate climate-related risks, opportunities, and sustainable solutions. Discover how GIS is being used today to understand and prepare for a future that requires more resilient communities, systems, and infrastructure. You'll explore the latest ArcGIS capabilities and learn how to create insight that drives positive action.
